SIDE changelog

Version 1.6, 2/28/11:
- Stability of prior annotation features have been improved substantially in the DefinedFeatureExtractor
- Saved XMI-formatted documents are now more portable. Where before, the absolute path of the file was necessary to re-load a file (tying a model to a computer), if that file does not exist SIDE will now check the /xmi folder for a file with the same name and load it if possible.
- Rare features and filtered features are now saved in XML feature tables.
- Weka features for POS bigrams, line length, and contains non stopword are now available in the DefinedFeatureExtractor. POS Bigrams must be separately loaded (click "load"); when you do this, it will POS tag the entire corpus, so be prepared to wait.
- DSA Sequence Extractor plugin has been added (courtesy of David Adamson)
- Sentence-level Rotten Tomatoes corpus (Pang and Lee, 2004) has been added to the default distribution
- Evaluation is now possible on a supplied test set for nominal class values. Functionality is not guaranteed for numeric class values. 
- Feature extraction plugins are now cached at prediction time, resulting in substantially faster prediction of unlabeled data.
- SIDE now has the ability (undocumented for now) to run as a server and accept examples for labeling and prediction as an HTTP POST request.

Version 1.5.2, 2/16/11:
-Fixed a display bug from the fix in version 1.5.1.
-Added a page in model evaluation displaying confidence distributions across labels.

Version 1.5.1, 2/7/11:
-Fixed problem with comparing features in Error Analysis window brought on by changes in version 1.5

Version 1.5, 2/5/11:
-Internal representation of feature tables changed from 2d maps to inverted index
-Internal representation of file lists changed to faster implementation
-Various changes made to algorithms for feature extraction and model building
-Clear option added to Convert to UIMA window.
-Altered AMI documents packed with SIDE by default and added Negotiation Maptask documents.

Version 1.4, 12/3/10:
-Added automatic stripping of non-ASCII characters.

Version 1.3.1, 11/2/10:
-Added connection to the feature context viewer in the Error Analysis window tables.
-Fixed some issues with Error Analysis Export to CSV option.
-Added a new feature extractor with additional options for n-gram features.

Version 1.3, 10/26/10:
-Added default values for many fields in the machine learning panels.
-Added feature context viewer in Defined Feature Panel
-Enabled multiline rows in error analysis tables
-Added feature filtering in highlighted feature dropdown in error analysis

Version 1.2, 10/13/10:
-Added feature selection option to error analysis interface.
-Added check/uncheck all buttons to feature table interface.
-Fixed widths of defined feature extractor lists.

Version 1.1.1, 9/27/10:
-Added Kappa to measures given in Defined Feature Extractor.

Version 1.1, 9/15/10:
-Altered the contract of FeatureExtractorPlugins, which now process DocumentLists instead of Strings, to allow contextual features.
-Added manual filtering ability to the Feature table page to allow removal of features from the feature space.
-Added the DefinedFeatureExtractor to the included plugins in SIDE.
-Included subsets of the AMI meeting corpus in the included datasets.
-Updated documentation from last year's edition.

Version 1.0, 07/20/10:
-Fixed a display bug which occasionally caused SIDE to hang after a machine learning model finishes building.
-Fixed a bug which would cause Weka's selected model to revert back to the default option (NaiveBayes)
-Added a changelog to keep track of changes, feature updates, and bug fixes.
-Altered the functionality of numeric error analysis categorization. Previously, the scale available to users went from 0 to 100, and sorted values by % relative error. The interface now gives the user the option of sorting by either % relative error or by absolute error, and adjusts the scale of the slider so that the far left will always give you all instances as "errors" and the far right will always give you all instances as "within threshold."
-Altered the functionality of vertical comparison in nominal error analysis. Our previous equation for calculating vertical similarity was |B - D| and it has now been changed to |B - A| - |B - D|. To illustrate, consider the following two confusion matrices:
(1)           (2)           (labels)
---------     ---------     ---------
|0.1|0.1|     |0.1|0.7|     | A | B | 
---------     ---------     ---------
|0.1|0.1|     |0.1|0.7|     | C | D |
---------     ---------     ---------
In the previous equation, both matrix 1 and matrix 2 would be given a similarity score of 0, because the similarities are the same, even though clearly matrix 2 is an example of a more interesting similarity than matrix 1. The new equation would give matrix 1 a score of 0 and matrix 2 a score of 0.6, correctly indicating that this matrix is a more interesting case of similarity.
