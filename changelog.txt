LightSIDE, Version 2.2.2, March 12, 2012:
- Fixed another issue with the Selected Documents Display (feel free to sort now)
- Added a clickable icon for Mac OS X users.

LightSIDE, Version 2.2.1, February 9, 2012:
- Fixed the Inequality features in the Feature Lab
- Simplified the ability to copy text from the Selected Documents Display table.
- Line length now counts number of words rather than number of characters.
- Features are now localized to give indices. This is a new development and as such may cause bugs. Hopefully not, though.
- The Selected Documents display now highlights n-gram features as a result of this change. This is also new and may not work exactly as intended yet.
- Extracting features to the same table was buggy before and a couple different bugs have been fixed in that vein.
- Fixed issues with loading non-text datasets and then switching to [No Text] in the GUI.
- Fixed an issue with the Supplied Test Set option which caused a confusion matrix full of zeros (thanks, Ryan)
- Prevented Selected Documents Display from failing to load any information when loading non-text datasets.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.10, December 12, 2011:
-Vertical comparison added back into comparison, along with new Cell Value comparison.
- Fixed a bug with the Selected Documents Display not displaying documents.
- Lab features and features added to the same table are now immediately available to model building, not only after freezing.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.9, December 7, 2011:
- Trigrams added to the TagHelperTools menu
- ExportShell added, which allows fast creation of saved feature tables (with weights) by command line

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.8, November 28, 2011:
- Fixed the run.bat file for Windows computers.
- Fixed an error with the new hit counts columns with numeric features.
- Improved handling of some things that have historically been problematic with the Line Length feature.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.7, November 16, 2011:
- Integrated Weka 3.7.5, updated from Weka 3.6.1, also getting rid of pesky and meaningless JDBC error messages along the way.
- Improved error popups for failed feature table and model building.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.6, November 2, 2011:
- Fixed a bug where feature tables would not notice when the annotation column was changed.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.5, October 26, 2011:
- ARFF feature export has been rewritten to be more consistent.
- Vertical comparison evaluation is now all absolute values, to make sorting easier.
- Previously, the Selected Documents Display occasionally would display the wrong instances if filtering by Error Cell or Feature. Those cases that were reproducible have been fixed.
- Big text areas in the model building panel are no longer editable.
- Key listeners have been added to most lists, so you can arrow through them instead of clicking.
- Highlighted rows in the feature table panel now have white foreground text.
- Feature lab features can now move freely between feature tables, rather than being tied to the table they were created in. This comes with a caveat. All terminal features in your created boolean features must exist in the feature table that you're moving this new feature into - this is how the lab feature knows what it appears in. If you try and move a lab feature into a table that doesn't know about its nonterminals, it will never appear.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.4, October 18, 2011:
- ARFF feature name export now removes spaces.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.3, October 5, 2011:
- Added CSV Export for feature tables (thanks David!)
- Sped up the Metafeatures extractor by not storing zeroes.
- Sped up changing the text field and drastically reduced the memory footprint of that option.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.2, October 5, 2011:
- Exporting to ARFF now works with features with single quotes in the feature name.
- Appending new features to a table now follows that table's rare feature threshold.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.1, October 4, 2011:
- Fixed an error with predicting labels when no prior annotation exists.

LightSIDE, Version 2.1.0, October 3, 2011:
LightSIDE is now feature complete. This version is what will likely be distributed to Carolyn's Applied Machine Learning class, at which point we'll discover bugs we didn't even know existed yet. Sorry, guys.

LightSIDE, Version 2.0.0, August 15, 2011:
All new version of SIDE. No reported bugs yet. That'll change soon.
